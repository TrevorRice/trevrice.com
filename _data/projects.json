		"description": "For my portfolio site, I aimed for a minimalist aesthetic, using a single typeface and only two colors. This ended up being the perfect opportunity to try out a few new technologies, particularly React, Gulp and Jekyll. The original plan was to build a single-page application with React and React Router to mimic a ‘typical’ website. Gulp was used to transpile ES6 JavaScript to ES5 (with the help of Babel and Browserify) and compile SCSS to CSS. After completing roughly eighty percent of the site (and learning a lot), in the end, I decided that I actually wanted users to have the ‘typical’ multi-page experience. Using Jekyll, I was able to generate a simple static site from a content-filled JSON file. A few Gulp tasks were used to build and deploy my Jekyll site.",
