		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Throughout college I struggled with the pressure of deciding what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Though I had plenty of interests—particularly computer science, graphic design and astronomy—I was never able to picture myself making a career out of them. It wasn’t until my second-to-last semester when I took a web development course that I found where my passions truly lie. Since then, I have been focused keeping up with the ever-changing world of front-end development.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>When I’m not researching a new framework or working through a tutorial, I’m probably wondering how I spent so much money on homebrewing equipment.</p>
